~ We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present

just before the show began.

Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should

have appeared did not come.

 

The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the

 

 

 

programme.

Women‘s age in western countries
I attended a strange birthday party last year. My teacher was
then 58 years old. But her fellow teacher said that we were
celebrating her 39th birthday! We were all surprised and
puzzled. After the party I was told by the fellow teacher that
American women have a special saying about birthdays. If a
woman is over 40, even if she is 80, her birthday will always be
the 39th. If she is in her thirties, her birthday will be the 29th.
And in her twenties, it is the 19th. They usually have their

"real" birthday when they are below 20. This shows that American women, especially older women, are
very sensitive about their ages. My teacher always says, "We want to be younger." So about the age of
western women, my advice is that if you don‘t know it, don‘t ask about it; if you really know it, and

don‘t mention it.
